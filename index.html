	If we are deliberate about finding great people, supporting
	and sharing their positive approaches for social change, the

	social innovators who are open at heart, have a fresh
	perspective on addressing challenges and have a very clear
	idea of their role in bringing about positive change.

	We wanted to understand what would happen if the values,
	processes and licences of the FOSS world were applied to areas
	outside of software. Could that provide key building blocks
	for further innovation? What are the conditions that optimise
	innovation for positive social change? How can openness add
	value to that process? This is at the heart of the
	Foundation’s contribution to the world.

        The holy grail for every funder is sustained impact - an
        approach continuing to influence behaviour positively long
        after your funding has run out. We believe people, rather than
        systems or organisations, are at the heart of sustaining
        change. The only true way is not a project plan but a
        champion, someone who will drive an idea through an ever
        changing landscape, to continue to make a real difference in
        the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        That is why we invest in individuals, building a family, not a
        portfolio. Each fellow is passionate about a unique cause they
        typically pursue both before and after the fellowship. We make
        a conscious choice not to limit our scope because we believe
        in the power of a diverse network. We strive to build a
        community of fellows who work together across disciplines,
        sparked by their similarities and strengthened by their
        differences.

        The more we share the thinking, working and practices of
        ourselves and our fellows, the better. Making these publicly
        available allows other organisations, project implementers,
        funders, policy makers, change agents, advocates and academics
        to engage - learn from what we have done, critically assess,
        give feedback and open the door to collaboration.
