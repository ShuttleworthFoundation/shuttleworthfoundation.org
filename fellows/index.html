        The Shuttleworth Foundation Fellowship Program funding
        consists of two components for each Fellow – the fellowship
        grant and the co-investment project funding.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fellowship grant covers the cost of the Fellow’s time for
        a year and is guaranteed to the fellow for that year. The
        grant amount varies and is determined by each Fellow’s salary
        equivalent outside of the fellowship.
      </p>
      <p>
        The co-investment project funding is the most unique part of
        the Fellowship Program, as Fellows are rewarded for investing
        in their own ideas. An amount of $250,000 is set aside per
        Fellow per year as potential project funding. This funding is
        unlocked through a light weight project pitch process and the
        Foundation tops up the Fellow’s own investment by adding at
        least 10 times as much funding from their project funding
        pool.
      </p>
      <p>
        Imagine the cost of a Fellow’s time for the year is agreed at
        $1000. As the fellowship year progresses, the Fellow realises
        that it would be beneficial to spend $100 in order to advance
        their idea. The Fellow then takes $900 home for the cost of
        her time and reinvests $100 back into the implementation of
        her idea, while the Foundation contributes at least another
        $1000, giving her a project budget of $1100.

	    Fellows are rewarded for the time and money they would
	    typically invest in their own ideas as a free agent anyway
	    by focusing their time and amplifying their funding.

	    Fellows pay closer attention to the relationship between
	    expenses and outcomes.
