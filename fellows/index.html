        The Shuttleworth Foundation Fellowship Program funding
        consists of two components for each Fellow – the fellowship
        grant and the project funding.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fellowship grant covers the cost of the Fellow’s time for
        a year and is guaranteed to the fellow for that year. The
        grant amount varies and is determined by each Fellow’s salary
        equivalent outside of the fellowship.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project funding is $275,000 per Fellow per year.
