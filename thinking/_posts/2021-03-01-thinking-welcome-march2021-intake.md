[Anil Dash](https://anildash.com/), our Honorary Steward for this round, selected a trio of outstanding individuals from a shortlist full of compelling candidates and ideas. 

Anil is CEO of [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) and an entrepreneur and writer who works to ensure technology transforms society for the better and serves those who are most vulnerable.
