This is your opportunity to meet the team, learn about our criteria, and alleviate any of your fears, concerns or confusions you have around the application process. It is not a chance to pitch your idea -- please save that for your application! -- but a session where we will explain our procedures, give you examples of successful applications, and answer as many of your questions as we possibly can.

- Find out who and what we look for - and why 
- Tap into our thoughts on openness and innovation so you can challenge us with yours
- Learn about the makeup of our fellowship community: individuals with diverse backgrounds from all corners of the globe


If you’re thinking of applying for a Shuttleworth fellowship but need to know more, this is for you. Spaces are limited, so don’t sleep!

The Shuttleworth Fellowship is open to applicants who have an idea to change the world for the better with openness at its core. We want to help you understand how we work, give you insight into our thinking, and enable you to communicate your idea to us in the best possible way.

How to get involved:

- Sign up for a session below
- Ask questions on registration or live during the event - you type them, we'll answer them over video stream
