Our application rhythm is changing. As a small foundation with a single source of capped funding, we continuously strive to protect the integrity and value of our fellowship programme. Occasionally, we make adjustments to keep costs in check. We must also adapt our model in response to the global challenges of our times. 

A mixture of both these elements means we are moving to one application round per year, with the first new cohort starting in March 2021. 

This has not been an easy decision, but it is necessary. The world grows increasingly chaotic, and it is more vital than ever to provide our fellows with an anchor, a stable framework, and the necessary resources to enable positive and much-needed social change. It also gives us more time to ensure we find the right people for our fellowship and offer them more support as they join the community. 

We continue to seek brave individuals with innovative ideas to change systems, shift thinking and apply openness in areas that are causing harm and inequity. How can you improve these systems, or replace them? What practical solutions do you have to unlock knowledge and empower citizens? Why are you the right person to turn your vision into a reality? We look forward to hearing from you from August 1st.
