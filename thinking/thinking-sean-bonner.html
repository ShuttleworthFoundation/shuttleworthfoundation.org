		<p>We are excited about <a href="{{ "/fellows/sean-bonner" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Sean's</a> work as he is literally putting the tools in the hands of the people who need them, localising the measure-report-decide cycle around environmental risk factors such as radiation and noise pollution.</p>
		<p>There are may questions around the quality, reliability and cost-effectiveness of open hardware in general, and specifically open sensing tools. Sean has shown that he can address these questions critically and engage relevant stakeholders and experts. We look forward to learning more about the answers to these questions over the fellowship year.</p>
