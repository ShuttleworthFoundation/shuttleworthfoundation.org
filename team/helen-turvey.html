					<p>
                    Helen Turvey (King) was originally tasked with defining international relations for the organisation, before moving into her present role where she is responsible for all of the Foundations strategic and operational elements.

                    <p>
                    Helen was educated in Europe, South America and the Middle East. With 15 years worth of experience working with international NGOs and agencies, she is driven by the belief that open technologies, content and processes have vast benefits and value to offer education, economies and communities in both the developed and developing worlds.
                    As well as holding various board positions, Helen is a lover of musicals, has smallholding ambitions (currently only chickens) and is the winner of *all* internal bowling competitions.
