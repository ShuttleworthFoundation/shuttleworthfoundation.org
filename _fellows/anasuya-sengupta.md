Re-imagining the internet is Anasuya’s way of re-imagining the world. She is deeply passionate about and committed to this cause. She is also well versed in both collaborative knowledge creation and community engagement. 

Having experienced both the best and worst of attempts at expanding online representation, she is undertaking [Whose Knowledge?](http://whoseknowledge.org), an initiative to drive inclusiveness and diversity in public knowledge online.

{% contentfor funding %}
We support Anasuya because we recognise that information and knowledge are produced through dynamics of power and privilege: whose knowledge is amplified, is based on whose voice is represented. This makes for a very specific perspective on “objective reality”. 

Anasuya is the ideal champion for this cause, and has the potential to succeed in increasing the diversity of online content during her Fellowship. Our hope is that there will be broader acceptance of, and an eagerness to invite such contributions, by knowledge initiatives more generally over time.

Anasuya’s work focuses on: 

- Representing and promoting the knowledge of marginalized voices
- Fighting for broad acceptance of knowledge initiatives
- Re-imaging the Internet as open, diverse and inclusive to the benefit of all
