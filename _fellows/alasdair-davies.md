An active conservationist and technologist all his working life, Alasdair Davies is combining these two passions with a third - openness - to bring affordable, customizable technology  to the field through the Arribada Initiative. He is designing, developing, and producing open hardware, in partnership with field interventions, employing open approaches and licences. His objective is to break down the barriers that inhibit access to such technologies, delivering better, cheaper, reliable solutions to help the global conservation community better monitor and protect our planet.

We support Alasdair because we believe that conservation is an area in which low cost, open technology can make a substantial difference. Alasdair's  relationship with specific  conservation efforts mean specific solutions to specific problems. His  focus on openness in conservation technology, rather than the  conservation of a specific animal or habitat, creates fertile ground for  broad collaboration and replication.
