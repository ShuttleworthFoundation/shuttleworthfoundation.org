# Background

The Foundation subscribes to the ethos embodied in free and open source software - collaboration and the freedom to use, adapt and share resources. We apply the free and open source philosophy as the underlying principle to our work. We use open licences to allow learning and resources to be used, adapted and shared widely. We give preference to the use of free and open source software in our own initiatives and require partners to do the same.

## Getting started

This repository contains all of the source code for our [website](https://shuttleworthfoundation.org/). We built it using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and the [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com) responsive CSS boilerplate.

### Install

Clone or download the repository to your computer. You'll need to have a local Jekyll [installation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) and [Bundler](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/). Just run `bundle install` from within the directory that contains the repository. This will install all the dependencies you need to run the site locally. Once finished, just run `jekyll serve` on the command line within the local copy of the repository.
