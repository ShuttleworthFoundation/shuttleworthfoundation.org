            <p>Over the years we have reviewed (and funded) many, many proposals and fellowship applications. In the current incarnation of the Foundation we support individuals to implement their idea for social change. Prospective applicants often ask us to narrow down the parameters for applications and be more specific about what we’re looking for. We are not planning on doing that, as we want to be surprised and intrigued by applicants, no matter how unconventional the idea may be.</p>
            <p>However, we can provide some thoughts on what to keep in mind while developing your application for our fellowship. We hope these are useful, for applying for the Fellowship, and for distilling the essence of your idea.</p>
            <p>Our number one ask is that openness be at the core of your idea and/or its implementation. Openness is not an add on. It is a&nbsp; fundamental approach to both participation and intellectual property.</p>
